> Now, AMP essentially asks you to build a parallel-universe version of your site that strips out not just anything thatâ€™s slow, but anything that might be slow.

> AMP tries to do something maybe even more significant: change the way that the web is built, killing off some technologies and advantaging others. In a world of controlled platforms and walled app gardens, the web is the last open space standing, built over two decades, and thereâ€™s something irksome about a few Google engineers deciding which parts to ban.

> The sample AMP pages on display this morning look a lot like the web of, say, 2002, shrunk down to a phone screen. Like an IE 5.5 emulator.

I think the problem with AMP HTML is that breaks a web page content into two sets. Each article needs to have a normal page and an AMP version.

Why canâ€™t google just extract the content of the article and display it? A reading friendly extraction like Safari reader view, Pocket, Readability.

And if any one think [the web today is boring](http://thenextweb.com/opinion/2015/09/23/zzzzzz/), the AMP move just makes the web pages much more boring because it cuts all the interactive things.
