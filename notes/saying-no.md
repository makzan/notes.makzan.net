This week, the page [Product strategy means saying No](http://www.productstrategymeanssayingno.com/) from Intercom is popular.

> Saying no is hard, but a great product manager isn’t afraid to make tough decisions to keep their product bloat-free.

This reminds me the famous quote from Steve Jobs:

> “People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.” — Steve Jobs

And a chapter [Start With No](https://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch05_Start_With_No.php) in the book [Getting Real](https://gettingreal.37signals.com/):

> Each time you say yes to a feature, you’re adopting a child. You have to take your baby through a whole chain of events (e.g. design, implementation, testing, etc.). And once that feature’s out there, you’re stuck with it. Just try to take a released feature away from customers and see how pissed off they get.
